# Coffee Classification Project

This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at classifying coffee beans or types using supervised learning techniques. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, and evaluation.

## Project Objectives
- Perform EDA to understand patterns and trends in the dataset.
- Preprocess the data, including handling missing values and feature scaling.
- Train and evaluate multiple supervised learning models to find the best classifier.

## Features
- Exploratory visualizations to understand the dataset.
- Implementation of classification models like Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Support Vector Machines.
- Hyperparameter tuning using grid search and cross-validation.
- Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Dataset
The dataset includes information about coffee characteristics, potentially including origin, flavor profile, and other features relevant to classification.
